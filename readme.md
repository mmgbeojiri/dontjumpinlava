# Don't Jump In Lava
"Don't Jump In Lava" is one of the very first games I've ever created. It was a simple scratch project with a platformer of a blue cube and terrible code. Almost a decade later, I'm creating a new improved version of this beloved game by translating an advanced scratch tutorial into Java. This project is purely just to help me learn the graphics of Java and game development in general. I will keep this open source.

I have been working on this project since October 16th, 2025 during my breaks in AP CSA.
